This project tracks patch provenance and licensing using the Developer
Certificate of Origin and Signed-off-by tags initially developed by
the Linux kernel project.  Because the documentation for this
procedure is licensed under the GPLv2, we have chosen not to include
it in our project directly.  Instead, please see:
